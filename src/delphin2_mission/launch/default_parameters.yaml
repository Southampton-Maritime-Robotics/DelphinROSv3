####### CONFIGURATION
status_timing: 2.               # To control publishing timing interval of node status (sec)

vertical/PID/weight/thruster/U_star: 0.9        # speed at which thruster weight is 0.5, in [m/s]
vertical/PID/weight/thruster/delta: 0.03        # width of the transition
vertical/PID/weight/controlsurface/U_star: 0.5  # speed at which control surface weight is 0.5
vertical/PID/weight/controlsurface/delta: 0.04  # width of the transition
# to use only thrusters, set U_star at forwards velocity higher than possible
# to use only control surfaces, set U_star to 0
# caution: delta cannot be zero (otherwise division by zero)
